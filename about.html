    <h2>Background & Interests</h2>

    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        My background is rooted in <strong>language, communication, and meaning</strong>.
        I bring extensive experience in English and linguistics with an English literature degree for my diploma and linguistics studies for my master's.
        I initially embarked on language teaching especially in helping Indonesian middle-schoolers and undergraduate students improve their English proficiency.
        With the teaching background and linguistics qualifications, I got offered a role as a human data annotator at third-party tech companies such as 
        <a href="https://www.mercor.com">Mercor,</a>
        <a href="https://www.micro1.ai">Micro1,</a>
        <a href="https://www.appen.com">Appen,</a> etc.
        I also have an experience in website evaluation specifically in improving the quality of the search result following a guideline from the client.
      </p>

      <p>
        I developed a strong interest in <strong>technology</strong> and how digital tools
        shape human communication.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        I’m known for learning quickly, adapting fast, and applying new knowledge as proven with my teaching background in my early career and then slowly transitioning to tech roles such as in data annotations and search engine quality improvement.
